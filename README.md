# Mac Essential Apps
A list of Apps that I personally use on Mac.

## Productivity
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Spotlight replacement for Mac

- [Flycut](https://github.com/TermiT/Flycut) - Simple Clipboard Manager for developers

- [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) - Makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.

- [Rocket](http://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) - Makes typing emoji faster and easier using Slack-style shortcuts.

## Misc
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/int/download/mac/) - Digital Music on the go.
